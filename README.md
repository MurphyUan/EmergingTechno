# Assessment Details

For the Module Emerging Technologies, I was assigned to create write about upcoming technologies based on what we were reviewing in class, this resulted in 3 notebooks **Computation, Fourier-Transform and Quantum-Computing**

These notebooks are all published on Github Pages on a [Jupyter-Lite](https://murphyuan.github.io/EmergingTechno/) instance. This makes it incredily easy to view and try to code out yourself.

Whenever you push a commit to the main branch the webpage is automatically reloaded and users that reload or join after the action has published the page, they will see the refactored / new information.
